# Laravel-Wallets Security Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive security improvements implemented for the Laravel-Wallets package. These enhancements address critical vulnerabilities and establish enterprise-grade security practices for handling cryptocurrency wallets and private keys.

## Security Vulnerabilities Addressed

### 1. **Private Key Exposure** (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: Private keys were stored in plain text in memory via the `WalletData` DTO
- **Solution**: Implemented `SecureString` and `SecureWalletData` classes with automatic memory cleanup and callback-based access

### 2. **Missing Security Contracts** (HIGH)
- **Problem**: No formal interfaces for security operations, validation, or audit trails
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive security interfaces including `SecurityServiceInterface`, `EncryptionServiceInterface`, and `KeyManagementInterface`

### 3. **Unbound Service Interfaces** (MEDIUM)
- **Problem**: Security services not properly registered in dependency injection container
- **Solution**: Updated `WalletsServiceProvider` with proper singleton bindings and security service registration

### 4. **No Audit Trails** (HIGH)
- **Problem**: No logging or tracking of security-sensitive wallet operations
- **Solution**: Implemented dual audit logging to both file system and database with suspicious activity detection

## Security Components Implemented

### Audit & Monitoring
- **Dual Logging**: Security events logged to both files and database
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Automated detection of unusual patterns
- **Risk Assessment**: Automatic risk level assignment to operations
- **Session Tracking**: Full traceability of security events

### Encryption & Integrity
- **Authenticated Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with authentication tags
- **Secure Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with high iteration counts
- **Key Rotation**: Secure key rotation without data loss
- **Integrity Verification**: HMAC-based data integrity checking

### Attack Prevention
- **Serialization Attacks**: Prevention of object serialization/deserialization
- **Timing Attacks**: Constant-time comparisons for sensitive operations
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Memory Leaks**: Automatic cleanup and secure disposal

## Configuration

### Security Configuration (`config/wallets.php`)
```php
'security' => [
    'permissions' => [
        'create_custodial_wallet' => ['required_role' => null],
        'export_private_key' => ['required_role' => 'admin'],
    ],
    'rate_limits' => [
        'create_custodial_wallet' => ['limit' => 10, 'window' => 3600],
    ],
    'required_measures' => [
        'export_private_key' => ['additional_confirmation', 'enhanced_logging'],
    ],
    'enable_suspicious_activity_detection' => true,
    'enable_audit_logging' => true,
    'enable_rate_limiting' => true,
]
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
WALLETS_LOG_PRIVATE_KEY_ACCESS=true
WALLETS_UNLOCK_TIMEOUT=300
WALLETS_ENABLE_SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY_DETECTION=true
WALLETS_ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true
WALLETS_ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
```

### Logging Channel Setup
```php
'security' => [
    'driver' => 'daily',
    'path' => storage_path('logs/security/security.log'),
    'level' => env('LOG_LEVEL', 'info'),
    'days' => 90,
    'permission' => 0640,
],
```

## Migration Impact

### Database Changes
- **New Table**: `wallet_audit_logs` for persistent audit trail
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing wallet functionality preserved
- **Deprecation Path**: Old `WalletData` class deprecated with migration path

### API Changes
