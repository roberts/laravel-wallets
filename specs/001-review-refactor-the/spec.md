# Feature Specification: Wallet Creation and Storage Refactor

**Feature Branch**: `001-review-refactor-the`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Review & refactor the creation & storage of wallets for multiple blockhains. Specifically with the Ethereum and Solana protocols that can be used in Laravel applications."

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the Laravel-Wallets package, I want a clear and unified way to create and manage wallets for different blockchains (initially Ethereum and Solana), so that I can easily integrate multi-chain wallet functionality into my Laravel applications.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Laravel application with the package installed, **When** I request to create a new Ethereum wallet, **Then** the system should generate a valid public address, private key, and store it securely.
2. **Given** a Laravel application with the package installed, **When** I request to create a new Solana wallet, **Then** the system should generate a valid public address, private key (or seed phrase), and store it securely.
3. **Given** a wallet has been created, **When** I retrieve the wallet from the database, **Then** its protocol (Ethereum/Solana) and address should be clearly identifiable.
4. **Given** an existing wallet, **When** I access it, **Then** I should be able to retrieve its public address but not its private key directly, unless explicitly requested through a secure method.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an unsupported blockchain protocol is requested for wallet creation? The system should throw a specific, clear exception.
- How does the system handle failures during key generation? It should not store a partial or invalid wallet and should report an error.
- What happens if there's an attempt to create a wallet for a protocol that hasn't been configured (e.g., missing RPC details)? The system should provide a clear error message.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a unified interface or service to create wallets for different blockchain protocols.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST support wallet creation for the Ethereum protocol.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST support wallet creation for the Solana protocol.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST persist generated wallets to a database, including the public address, an encrypted version of the private key/seed, and the associated blockchain protocol.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST ensure private keys and seed phrases are always encrypted when stored in the database.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide a method to retrieve a wallet's public information (address, protocol) by its ID or other unique identifier.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide a secure method to temporarily decrypt and access a wallet's private key for signing transactions.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST allow associating a wallet with a user or other model in the Laravel application.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST throw a predictable exception if wallet creation is attempted for an unsupported protocol.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Wallet**: Represents a blockchain wallet.
  - Attributes: Public Address, Encrypted Private Key/Seed, Protocol (e.g., ETH, SOL), Owner/User relationship.
- **Blockchain/Protocol**: Represents a specific blockchain network.
  - Attributes: Name (e.g., Ethereum), Symbol (e.g., ETH), configuration details. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should protocol-specific configuration like RPC endpoints be part of this model or stored elsewhere?]
